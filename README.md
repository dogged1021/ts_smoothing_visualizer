# Time Series Smoothing: an Interactive Visualizer

[![Try the App](https://img.shields.io/badge/TRY%20THE%20APP-FF4B4B)](https://timeseriessmoothing.streamlit.app/)


This repository contains the code for a Streamlit app that visualizes time series smoothing techniques. It includes both real and synthetic datasets and lets you compare how different methods behave with adjustable parameters.

*Note: The app was developed while writing this Medium article: [Six Approaches to Time Series Smoothing](https://medium.com/@dmitriy.bolotov/six-approaches-to-time-series-smoothing-cc3ea9d6b64f)*

**Features**
- Adjustable smoothing parameters
- Visual comparison across methods
- 5 datasets

**Supported methods**: Moving Average, Exponential Moving Average, Savitzky-Golay, LOESS, Gaussian Filter, Kalman Filter
